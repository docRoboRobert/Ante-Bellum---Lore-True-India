 #Events
 lemuria_prov_event.1.t:0 "Woman Warriors of Kyushi"
 lemuria_prov_event.1.d:0 "To the south of the Cape of Rains lies a remote island of volcanic origin. More precisely - two islands: Chihaib and Kyushi. The name of the latter, as the local merchants and sailors claim, comes from the people the island is inhabited by. People of Kyushi Island, though speaking Dardic language as their mainland relatives, have developed their own unique and specific culture. Still similar to Indo-Europeans but with more asian characteristics, likely due to contact with Chinese and Malayan merchants. This is because the island gradually developed into important trade hub and anchoring stop for the ships trading between Persia and East Asia. Many merchants choose to stop by the island to shorten their route by avoiding Assamese Bay, pick up local goods and repair their ships. This is thanks to the hilly island being covered in lush, semi-tropical forests, perfect for construction and ship-building. This, combined with extreme monsoon periods, allows the island to grow almost any tropical crop, despite its latitude. Locals have also reported the use of iron and zinc ores. \n \nBut that's not what have caught your attention. No, the island is actually interesting for its society. Population of the island (which is over 7500 people) is defended solely by the caste of skilled warriors in with unusual dress code. A female caste warriors to be exact. They are known as Kyushi Warriors and it is them that the island and the people take their name from. The origin of the term is unknown but it most likely that it refers to the name of legendary woman who first established this guard. \n \nKyushi Warriors are given the order to protect the people and the culture, defend the island from any foreign invaders and aid those in need during the time of peace. Men in the meantime, deal with craftsmanship, field work and trade. Only the elite of women embark on the path of Kyushi Warriors. Those who do not, hold marginal status, similar to that in most early societies. It is expected that in family with more than one daughter, one will choose the Kyushi path, though only fraction will complete the training. In any case, Kyushi warriors have proven to be masterful fighters in their unusual style of combat and they did so by defending the island thus far."

 tibet_tag_event.1.d:0 "The monsoon season of the year 1489 was exceptionally bad for the Tibetan Plain. A combination of misfortune, weather patters, and perhaps even divine wraith, has caused unseen storms to form over St. Timur Sea and plow through the lush plain, causing tremendous damage. Many locals believes that unusually destructive weather is a punishment from Saint Timur the Lame himself for not accepting his teachings. Whatever was the cause of it, over the course of 10 days relentless monsoon flooded the whole regions. Villages either sunk or were blown do rubble. Wooden buildings set on fire by the lightnings, only to be put down by the litres of water raining from the sky. Rivers have breached its banks, destroying all the crop fields around them. \n \nOnly after the 10th day the sky cleared for the first time and the monsoon softened.

 lemuria_discover_event.1.t:0 "Storm gathers beyond Timur's Bay"
 lemuria_discover_event.1.d:0 "Beyond Persia and beyond Makran Coast lies dry coast of Timuristan - for many considered the last familiar land before the (unknown to Europeans) exotic territories of orient mark their dominant presence. Secluded from the north by the Karakoram-Changtang mountain chain, exists a lush and extermely wet Tibetan Plain. The flat lowlands of Tibet, marked with hudreds of rivers and subtropical forests, form rich region which has been a cradle of civilization since the days of Babylon. Here on this region, vast fields of fertile land gave rise to dozens of kingdoms, some of Dardic, some of Tibetan origin, which amassed their wealth from their productive river basins or from strategic coastal ports. Those kingdoms still retain their unique culture in 1444 but with visible heavy influence from both the west and the east. Beyond Tibet, lands of legendary Chinese Empire begin and more to the south, dense jungles of Burma and Siam arise. \n \nIt used to be that for millenia Timuristan served a role of a bridge between spice emperors of the east and princes of Persia. Nobody paid much attention to presumably endless Ocean below the St. Timur Sea. After all, no sailors could find any land south of Sinhd. That was the state of being for centuries, up until now. The recent technological progress in navigation and broad philisophy allows for balder voyages and sparks wonder in the hearts of adventurers. New ships design let merchants sail further and more secure than ever before. \n \nCould it be that a new mythical land awaits to be discovered on the other hemisphere? Perhaps a huge changes in our perception of the world are soon to come."

 lemuria_discover_event.2.d:0 "Sailors and merchants are prime source of any news from distant lands. While usually those news are either of very low value or entirely false, this one particular seems so fantastical that it caught attention of the court. Apparently, news spread from muslim merchants trading on the exotic Swahili Coast that there's mystical land of uttermost exotic cultures, creatures and landforms. This mythical land is supposed to lie far beyond the equator, where known world ends and sea is filled with gigantic monsters, before it starts boils entirely. Perhaps unreachable paradise so far to the south that humans living there walk upside down. All the reports seem to give this land the same ambiguous name - L E M U R I A. There have been many different fairytales about arcadian land of wonders, suited far beyond the known world but this case seems to be much more real as many merchants report the same information and their relations very much allign. While surely not Eden-like, something Lemuria-like could exist there. We just currently lack the capability to do much about it."

 lemuria_discover_event.3.d:0 "Since we now own coast of the Indian Ocean, our merchants were able to venture out and gather key informations about trade routes, coastline and exotic merchants native to the region. It turns out the news about lands off the african coast weren't just baseless rumours. Swahili traders and arabian merchants funneling exotic goods to trade with Europeans all know of many islands near East Africa, from which they buy all sorts of goods. The only problem being, we know nothing concrete nor where to even ask for details. It becomes obvious that further search requires proper investigation. An expedition or perhaps hiring those exotic merchants should suffice."

There exist vast lands east to the Sultanate of Kilwa and it is indeed called ''Lemuria''! We have come to face a marvelous discovery about our world. Our envoys who has studied and infiltrated the Sultanate have confirmed that muslim traders regurarly acquire exotic goods from there, which they later transport to Zanzibar, and from there, further into known world. \n \nNow that the existance of Lemuria has been defacto confirmed, the era of great discoveries of international level is right at our doorsetp. We still haven't learned anything precise about the mysterious region, not how it looks like, not what size and shape it is nor even where exactly to search for it... all that is lies somewhere beyond the island of Madagascar. We shall remember that Swahili merchants don't just trade with us only. Very soon, the news will spread and more and more nations will catch the rumour, perhaps even confirm it themselves. We have gained a large upper hand in ventures and we shall act upon it FAST! Obviously, we can't rely on 2nd-hand reports anymore. If we ever plan to secure immense wealth Lemuria may offer, we need to start taking heavy efforts ourselves... now! \nProper expeditions must be prepared and launched as well as proper adventure-hungry captains must be hired to command them."
